# ANDROID STRING PASSING APP

## What was my goal

I wanted to make an app to learn how to pass data between two activities in Android.

## What I did

- Create a new Android app with a main Activity and a second Activity.
- Pass some data (a string) from the main Activity to the second using an Intent, and display that data in the second Activity.
- Send a second different bit of data back to the main Activity, also using an Intent.


## What I have learned

- How to create a new Activity in Android Studio.
- How to define parent and child activities for Up navigation.
- How to start an Activity with an explicit Intent.
- How to pass data between each Activity with an explicit Intent.
